        <h1>More than just slides.</h1>
        <p>Notist is a place to build your public speaking portfolio. A place to share your slides, but also to collate feedback, tweets, photos, resources and everything to create a permanent history of your speaking events.</p>

        <h2>Your speaking portfolio.</h2>
        <p>Event websites come and go, and soon any record of your appearance is lost. The next time an event organiser asks where you’ve spoken, what are you going to tell them? Send them a link to your Notist profile.</p>

            <h3>Share a presentation</h3>
            <p>Create a beautiful page for your presentation ahead of time, set it to go live with a predictable, tidy URL. Add your slides (either uploaded or hosted elsewhere) and links. After the event, add photos, tweets and video that make you look cool as.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Advanced editing</h3>
            <p>Want to replace a single slide with a new image, pick a new poster slide, or drop a video into the middle of your deck? You can do that. Got resources for a workshop or private event that you want to share but keep unlisted? No problem.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Over-share</h3>
            <p>Speaking a lot? We get it. Add your future schedule so superfans can see where you’re going to be next. Duplicate an existing presentation and change the title slide. Add your bios and headshots so conference organisers can grab them without invading your inbox.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Wait, you said permanent</h3>
            <p>We did. We can't promise Notist will be here forever, so we’ve made plans. First, you'll pay a little for some features. That helps. Second, all your data is sharable and exportable (in hip JSON format). You can even host your listings on your own site.</p>

        <h3>Join us</h3>
        <p>You can use Notist in a casual way for free. For regular public speakers, we have Pro accounts too. You can sign up right now, no payment required, and begin using all the features with a 14 day free trial.</p>

        <h4>About Notist</h4>
        <h2 class="left">Who’s behind this?</h2>
        <p>Notist is a project originally founded by Drew McLellan and Rachel Andrew, and now owned and operated by Drew. We know a lot about content management, and we know a lot about public speaking. We thought we would bring these two things together and that place is Notist. Somewhere not just to host slides, but everything from the handouts to share with listeners to their thoughts by way of curated social media posts.
        At the start of 2023 Rachel stepped back to focus on other projects, and Notist continues under Drew’s guidance at Under Engineering Ltd.</p>
